      content: `Thank you once again, for allowing me to be interviewed for the full-stack developer position here today. 

			My name is Abduljelel, and I'm a Software Engineer who has had several years of experience developing solutions to modern tech problems. Having been heavily influenced back my course of study at the university, electrical/electronic engineering, I started as an embedded software/system engineer with ERIT. I was part of the development team that helped design, plan and maintain embedded systems in products. 
			My role often includes software development, which piqued my interest in web development. Most recently, I have held positions where my primary assignments were to create intuitive and interactive user interfaces and to build secure and scalable backend systems and functionalities. /n
			
			Based on my experience, and my background working with companies with vastly different requirements from their tech team, I would describe myself as somebody who's adaptable and flexible to different work approaches, prefer and promote a collaborative environment, is highly self-motivated, and last but not the least, a natural and happy learner. 
			
			I always back myself to profer a viable solution to any tech-related problem. Hence, after reading the job description carefully, I knew I had to apply for this role with your company. And I'm excited to learn more about this opportunity. Thank you!
