The first step to successful long-term storage of food is choosing the right food products. Food that contains higher levels of moisture will have a shorter shelf life than dry foods.

The golden rule is that good candidates for long-term food storage will have less than 10 percent moisture content and be low in oil content. Food that is high in oil content will become rancid in storage.

Furthermore, it is better to turn to store mostly **bulk foods –** food products purchased and consumed in large quantities. You can select from a wide range of dry foods such as

* White rice
* White beans
* Wheat
* &#x20;Kamut
* Corn
* Split peas
* Lentils
* Pasta
* Rolled oats

 
Vegetables and fruits must be dehydrated, very low in moisture, and dry enough to snap. Dehydrated potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions are good long-term dehydrated food storage items. Properly processed and freeze-dried fruits, vegetables, and meats are also good candidates for longer-term storage.
