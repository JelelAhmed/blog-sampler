Email may be one of the oldest forms of digital communication, but it remains the most effective and widely used channel through which companies choose to nurture leads and generate sales.

So, if you don’t already have an email marketing campaign in place, you’re already lagging behind some of your competitors. Luckily, it’s better late than never. And there’s no better place to start than here – deciding on your preferred platforms for email marketing. Keep reading…

## Why Do You Need an Email Marketing Platform?

Do you want to make this year the reference on your company's balance sheets? Then there's no way around opting for an email marketing service. One of the key challenges marketers and businesses face with their email marketing efforts is simply the amount of time it takes to create an effective and stunning-looking email from the ground up. Those who manage to devote enough time to creating their mails, still tend to end come up with email copies well below expectations. This can only hinder productivity while dragging your email marketing ROI down. And worse still, the company may decide to abandon its email marketing strategy altogether if they don't see tangible results. Which is a pity!

It is a pity because, with a little investment, companies can harness the full power of email marketing to help grow their business. Besides, good platforms for email marketing don't have to be expensive before they can be valuable to your email marketing campaign. You can find plenty of free tools and software to help you save time and make more money.

## Why The Choice of Email Marketing Platform Matters

Leveraging automation is the most effective way to deploy your email marketing campaign to reach high potential customers who are within your target market. However, much of its success depends on the email marketing platform you choose to work with. That's because of all the many things that are under your control – like crafting personalized messages and images, list building, and running tests – email delivery isn't one of them. Hence, any platform you choose must have the capability of delivering mails directly into the target inbox. NOT SPAM. NOT promotions even. But INBOX.

And why’s any of that so important? Well, what’s the likelihood a potential client opens an email that never gets delivered? No chance!

## What Makes a Good Email Marketing Platform?

It is really important that before you settle on a platform, you are very clear on what grounds you came to that decision. You certainly don’t want to choose an email marketing software simply because you thought the name was cool.

When you want to choose your email marketing platform, here are 5 things to look consider:

- **E-commerce Integration and Optimization**: It's no secret that many businesses are on e-commerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and Magento. Those providers that come with in-house optimizations for these platforms should be at the top of your list. Also, don't forget that whatever CRM tool you use should be integrated well with your email marketing platform of choice.

- **Should Support Automation**: This may be stating the obvious but automation is one of those things still largely underutilized by businesses. Embrace automation with your choice of platform for email marketing.

- **Scalability is Important, Too**: There's nothing wrong with working with a free platform, especially when you're just starting. However, as your business grows and your needs change, would that necessitate a change in platform mid-flight? Perhaps, a platform that allows you to scale up and can accommodate your needs as the business grows would be the better option from the beginning.

- **The Price Must Be Right For You**: Ultimately, money is an object and your decision may well be dictated by your budget. And that's fine. Some email marketing software is free up to a certain point. Thankfully, most email marketing platforms support you to start small and pay for only packages you use – including some of the big players.

- **Must be Reliable, Period**: Your beautifully crafted and timely emails are no better than used tissue paper if they are not sitting in your subscriber's inboxes waiting to be opened. Email delivery is really EVERYTHING if you want to see ROI.
