##**Why Leave a Review?**##



> “*93% of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of a business, and 87% trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations*


You may be sitting there and asking yourself: why should I write about my experience using this product or that service? Chances are if I come asking for a personal recommendation about a product you are familiar with, you’d be happy to offer your unique experiences and opinions to help steer my eventual decision. Well, it would please you to know that 87 out of 100 customers would also appreciate learning about a product or business by reading about your experiences online. For the small coffee shop just around the corner, your reviews build confidence in their service. And also translates to much-needed visibility.

Only from the small matter of leaving a review, you play a major part in fostering that trust and relationship between business and customer. That is how you become more than just a customer but a big part of every success story.

### **Here are a few major reasons why you should get into the act of leaving reviews:** &#xA;

1. &#x20;**Consumer Decisions are Influenced by Reviews:**
   The fact more than 93% of consumers read reviews to get an insight about a particular product or company says it all really. When a consumer thinks of a new product, service, or business, they want to gather as much information as possible. As long as consumers feel confident about the honesty and experience shared by a reviewer, they will allow online reviews to influence their decision about whether to try out a new product or not.

2. **You Provide Valuable Support to Small Business:**
   Small businesses are going through a tough time just trying to stay afloat, especially when they compete against the reputation of larger competitors. For these businesses, every sale means a lot and can make a huge difference. But another thing that has the potential to be a difference maker is the reviews you leave them.  You instantly throw your hat in the ring as a champion for startups and SMEs.

   Reviews, especially positive ones, draw the attention of potential customers. There's always a bit of hesitancy when dealing with an unknown entity but people are more likely to trust and follow the action of others. So, your reviews on a reputable platform like Servicerate can open the floodgates for many small businesses who need every bit of (good) advertising it can get.

3. **You Deserve to Be Heard**
   As a customer, you must feel strongly about a particular product or brand you have firsthand knowledge about. Whenever you feel like expressing that feeling, Servicerate rightly believes you deserve to be heard. It's empowering to know that your opinion matters, whether you were satisfied or dissatisfied with a product.

   In a perfect world, we want our review to put those businesses that are doing a good job in the spotlight. But bad companies need to be called out too. Ultimate, every review you write helps steer businesses in the right direction
