When it comes to vehicles, two products can be so similar that it’s either one or the other. The BMW 4 Series and the Lexus ES sedans are both beautifully crafted and elegant cars that would look good in any garage.  But our smart guess is that you only need one of them. The BMW 4 Series vs. the Lexus ES 350: which one is right for you? Let’s find out!

**FUEL ECONOMY AND RANGE**

Going by the renowned EPA test cycle, the **4 Series Sedan** has got better mileage than the ES. The regenerative braking system improves fuel efficiency by converting inertia back into energy instead of wasting it. While this cool feature is available for all engine variants the 4 series has to offer, this feature is only available on the ES hybrid.

Furthermore, all engines of the 4 series automatically turn off when the vehicle is brought to a halt, this not only saves fuel but reduces environmental pollution as well. The 4 series allows you to opt in and out of this feature as you please, just another perk you don't get with the ES Hybrid.

**ERGONOMICS**  

One thing about the 4 series is that it’s very techy. The wipers are rain-sensitive so would automatically adjust their speed according to the amount of rainfall on the windshield. This is a far cry from the manually operated wipers on the ES Hybrid which have to be constantly adjusted according to the situation.

The sophisticated BMW of Bakersfield 4 series sedan is installed with a helpful Parking Assistant that can parallel park or back into a parking spot by itself. You don’t have this with the ES Hybrid.

**WARRANTY**

When it comes to warranty, BMW offers significantly longer terms than Lexus. Specifically, it's a 12 vs. 6-year difference, and that’s massive.

For scheduled maintenance, BMW will pay for an extra 2 years and 26,000 miles longer than Lexus, which only offers one year of scheduled maintenance and 10,000 miles.

There’s also the small matter of available dealers. Essentially, there are 44 more of them for BMW compared to Lexus, which makes it much easier to enjoy your warranty package for the 4 Series compared to ES.

**FINAL VERDICT**

The BMW 4 series is a great option for anyone edging towards a bit of sophistication and style. It's a very elegant and good-looking option, drives well, and consumes little fuel.

The Lexus ES is another great option to have. It shines in the ride comfort, refinement, and value-for-money departments. It does look very elegant and can save you fuel as well.

Both are great cars that compete in the same markets but play to different interests. Depending on your situation, the right sedan for you can be pretty obvious to spot.
