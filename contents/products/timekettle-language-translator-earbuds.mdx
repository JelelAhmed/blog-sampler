# **Traveling Abroad Without a Local Language? Check Out Timekettle's M3 Language Translator Earbuds**



Everyone keeps saying how important it is to travel – it’s hard to argue with that. Traveling changes you both physically and psychologically. Traveling opens your mind up to new realities and new possibilities. Going places changes your perspectives. Broadens your horizons.

Traveling is an investment in yourself that’s hard to quantify. Its value is not in hard currency but in the new places that you know, the new people that you meet, the new cultures that you experience, the new foods that you eat, the new lifestyles that you live, and the new knowledge that you learn.

All that should get anyone super excited about what they are about to experience in a new country. Until you remember that; there’s a language barrier to overcome. That’s enough to take the wind out of anyone’s sails. 

Do you then start worrying about how you’ll meet new people? How you’ll get around? And how you’ll shop or ask for directions? Surely, there are ways to get around this problem. But most of the existing solutions to overcome the language barrier are not always practical for my liking. And the less said about convenience the better.

## **Timekettle M3 Language Translator Earbuds – Language no Longer a Barrier**  

At the tail end of 2022, not speaking the language of the country you are traveling to should not be a deal breaker. Some may argue not being able to speak the language is one of the charms of traveling. Occasionally, it may provide an extra source of fun!

No matter how staunch a pro traveller you are, it is hard to dismiss the potential challenges waiting in store for you in a new country or location if you do not speak the language. Feeling a little lost when you cannot communicate may bring a few hearty laughs and giggles, but it does take away from the experience. It does leave you feeling like a fish out of a pond. You would always have the feeling that you could have gotten more out of every situation if only you spoke the language.

I presume you have been able to manage the language problem when visiting a new country thus far, but how practical are those solutions?

It’s not always possible to travel within a group, and it’s not every time you can call on a local travel attendant to bridge the gap. I know Google is great but you’d still have to, well, GOOGLE – how convenient!

## **Timekettle M3 Earbuds – A Truly Practical and Convenient Solution to the Language Problem**

We have been here before with Timekettle language translator earbuds. Now in its third iteration, the Timekettle M3 Earbud is a practical and convenient solution to your language problems whenever you travel. Unlike your regular left and right ear earbuds, the M3 language translator is designed to be shared with the person you want to have a conversation with. Simply give one to your new friend in a new country and you both can have a seamless conversation in two separate languages, with the earphones in each ear speaking in the language you both can understand. Translator magic that!

The M3 earbuds support the translation of 40 languages and some 93 accents in real-time, including Chinese, Arabic, and Korean. You don't need to be connected to the internet to use the translator as some major languages work even when you're offline. Built on top of some of the world’s leading translator engines like DeepL, Google, and Microsoft, the company says that the M3 translation accuracy reaches 95% with a hardly noticeable 0.5-second delay.

There are no cutting corners with this M3. You get everything else you have come to expect from a premium earphone – an ergonomic fit, first-class Active Noise Cancellation for the best listening experience, and professional-grade EQ tuning capabilities. It is wireless and perfect for listening to music and answering calls, but there’s no doubt what the M3 wants to be known for.

I don't think a language translator can be more practical and convenient than what the M3 offers. While the Timekettle app is available on Android and iOS platforms, all the translations happen on-device and play directly into your ear and the ear of the person you’re conversing with. The almost unnoticeable time delay allows people to communicate more naturally.

 

Booking foreign trips? Check. Touring museums? Working overseas? Check. Unless you speak the language of your host country yourself, it doesn’t get better than Timekettle language translator earbuds.

Just spare a second and think how handy Timekettle’s M3 earbuds can be in the streets of Berlin, Paris, or Madrid. You do not just go along, but be among. The M3 helps keep the conversation going.
